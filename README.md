# Personal-Productivity-dashboard
A responsive web-based productivity dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project combines essential daily tools like a To-Do List, Daily Planner, Goals Tracker, Pomodoro Timer, and Live Weather into one interface.  All data is stored using localStorage, making the application fully client-side with no backend dependency.
